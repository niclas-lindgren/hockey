"""The observe-decide-act AI operator loop (issue #11).

Turns calendar-source recovery from something a human manually chooses
pipeline commands for into a bounded, deterministic loop:

    observe (source_health, issue #3)
        -> decide (a pure policy function, no LLM required)
            -> act (dispatch through the #10 action registry)
                -> evaluate (re-observe)
                    -> continue, retry, escalate, or finish

Every step is recorded in the run manifest's ``action_log`` (target,
action_id, arguments, rationale, policy_rule, result, transition) via
:meth:`RunManifest.record_action_transition`, so a run can resume safely
after interruption using recorded operator state.

The policy (:func:`decide_action_for_source`) is a plain function — pure,
synchronous, no network or LLM call — so it's fully unit-testable and never
requires an LLM provider to run. An LLM harness may *propose* an action
instead of using the default policy via the ``action_proposer`` parameter,
but a proposal that isn't a known registry action id is rejected and the
loop falls back to the deterministic policy — the harness can influence
*which* registered action runs, never invent a new one.

This loop does not replace or duplicate Stage 2 scraping itself: it only
repairs the unified cache (via the same actions available through
``rvv-miniputt``) and escalates what it can't fix, then defers to the
existing pipeline to re-run Stage 2 and pick up the repaired cache.
